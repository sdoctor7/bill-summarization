objects to u.n. security council resolution 2334 .
such resolution characterizes israeli settlements in the west bank and east jerusalem as illegal and demands cessation of settlement activities .
calls for such resolution to be repealed or fundamentally altered and allows all final status issues toward a two-state solution to be resolved through direct bilateral negotiations between the parties .
rejects efforts by outside bodies to impose solutions that set back the cause of peace .
demands that the united states ensure that no action is taken at the paris conference on the israeli-palestinian conflict scheduled for january 15 , 2017 , that imposes an agreement or parameters on the parties .
notes that granting membership and statehood standing to the palestinians at the un , its specialized agencies , and other international institutions outside of the context of a bilateral peace agreement with israel would cause severe harm to the peace process , and would likely trigger penalties under the department of state , foreign operations , and related agencies appropriations act , 2016 regarding limitations on assistance to the palestinians .
rejects any efforts by international organizations to use such resolution to further isolate israel and urges the u.s. government to act where needed to counter any such efforts .
urges : ( 1 ) the u.s. presidential administrations to uphold the practice of vetoing all security council resolutions that recognize unilateral palestinian actions or dictate terms and a time line for a solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict ; and ( 2 ) the incoming presidential administration to work with congress to create conditions that facilitate the resumption of negotiations without preconditions between israelis and palestinians to achieve a sustainable agreement acceptable to both sides .
reaffirms that it is u.s. policy to seek a sustainable , just , and secure two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
