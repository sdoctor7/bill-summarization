keep it in the ground act of 2017 this bill amends the outer continental shelf lands act to prohibit the bureau of ocean energy management ( boem ) from issuing , renewing , reinstating , or extending any nonproducing lease , or issuing any authorization for the exploration or production of oil , natural gas , or any other fossil fuel in the arctic ocean , atlantic ocean , pacific ocean , gulf of mexico , or any other area of the outer continental shelf .
boem shall also cancel within 60 days any lease issued in the beaufort sea , cook inlet , or chukchi sea ( three of the five bodies of water that encompass the alaska outer continental shelf ) .
the bureau of land management ( blm ) must not issue , renew , reinstate , or extend any nonproducing lease for the exploration or production of any onshore fossil fuels , including coal , oil , tar sands , oil shale , and gas , on land subject to the mineral leasing act .
the bill provides for exceptions if there is an imminent national security threat that would be significantly reduced by granting an exception .
in addition , boem and the blm may allow a nonproducing lease to be renewed or extended if the lease contract was signed before this bill , and giving effect to any provision of this bill is likely to lead to a material breach of contract .
