constitutional amendment this joint resolution proposes a constitutional amendment prohibiting total outlays for a fiscal year from exceeding total receipts for that fiscal year unless congress authorizes the excess by a three-fifths roll call vote of each chamber .
the prohibition excludes outlays for repayment of debt principal , receipts derived from borrowing , and receipts or outlays of the social security and medicare trust funds .
the amendment requires the president to annually submit to congress a budget in which total outlays do not exceed total receipts .
the balanced budget requirement does not apply if : a declaration of war is in effect or if the united states is engaged in military conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security , or during the fiscal year or preceding fiscal year , the u.s. economy grew by less than 0 % in real gross domestic product during two or more consecutive quarters or the unemployment rate was more than 7 % during two or more consecutive months .
the amendment prohibits a court from enforcing the requirements by ordering cuts to social security or medicare payments unless the funds available to the trust fund for a program are not sufficient to cover the outlays that would occur during the year if the fund were fully solvent .
