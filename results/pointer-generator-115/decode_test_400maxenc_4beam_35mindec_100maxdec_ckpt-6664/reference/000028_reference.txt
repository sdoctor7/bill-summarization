collegiate housing and infrastructure act of 2017 this bill amends the internal revenue code to allow tax-exempt charitable or educational organizations to make collegiate housing and infrastructure grants to certain tax-exempt social clubs ( e.g. , college fraternities and sororities ) which apply such grants to their collegiate housing property .
a `` collegiate housing and infrastructure grant '' is a grant to provide , improve , operate , or maintain collegiate housing property that may involve more than incidental social , recreational , or private purposes .
the grant must be for purposes that would be permissible for a dormitory or other residential facility of the college or university with which the collegiate housing property is associated .
the grant may not be used to provide physical fitness facilities .
