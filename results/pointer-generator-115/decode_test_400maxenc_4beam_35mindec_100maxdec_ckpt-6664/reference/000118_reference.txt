regulatory accountability act of 2017 this bill amends the administrative procedure act to revise and expand the requirements for federal agency rulemaking by requiring agencies , in making a rule , to base all preliminary and final factual determinations on evidence and to consider the legal authority under which the rule may be proposed , the specific nature and significance of the problem the agency may address with the rule , any reasonable alternatives for the rule , and the potential costs and benefits associated with such alternatives .
the bill requires agencies to publish advance notice of proposed rulemaking in the federal register for major rules and for high-impact rules ( rules having an annual cost on the economy of $ 100 million or $ 1 billion or more , respectively ) and for negative-impact on jobs and wages rules and those that involve a novel legal or policy issue arising out of statutory mandates .
the notice must include a written statement identifying the nature and significance of the problem the agency may address with a rule , the legal authority under which the rule may be proposed , the nature of and potential reasons to adopt a novel legal or policy position , and a solicitation for written data , views , or arguments from interested persons .
additionally , the bill : ( 1 ) sets forth criteria for issuing major guidance ( agency guidance that is likely to lead to an annual cost on the economy of $ 100 million or more , a major increase in cost or prices , or significant adverse effects on competition , employment , investment , productivity , innovation , or ability to compete ) or guidance that involves a novel legal or policy issue arising out of statutory mandates ; and ( 2 ) expands the scope of judicial review of agency rulemaking by allowing immediate review of rulemaking not in compliance with notice requirements and establishing a substantial evidence standard for affirming agency rulemaking decisions .
