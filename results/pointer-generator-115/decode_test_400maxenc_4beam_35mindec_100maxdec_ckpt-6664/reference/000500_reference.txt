commodity program improvement act of 2017 this bill reauthorizes and modifies several department of agriculture ( usda ) commodity programs that were included in the 2014 farm bill ( the agricultural act of 2014 ) .
the programs provide price and income support to farmers for covered commodities .
the bill modifies the agricultural risk coverage-county program , which provides revenue loss coverage at the county level by issuing payments when the actual county crop revenue of a covered commodity is below a specified amount .
usda currently calculates payments for farms located in more than one county using one of the counties ( known as an administrative county ) .
the bill requires the payments to be calculated using the payment rate for the county in which the land is physically located .
the bill also requires usda to update the crop acreage base used to determine payments under commodity programs for the 2019 crop year .
usda must determine the updated base acres on a farm using covered commodities planted on the farm during the 2014-2017 crop years .
