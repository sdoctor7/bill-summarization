currency reform for fair trade act this bill amends the tariff act of 1930 to include as a `` countervailable subsidy '' requiring action under a countervailing duty or antidumping duty proceeding the benefit conferred on merchandise imported into the united states from foreign countries with fundamentally undervalued currency .
a `` benefit conferred , '' in cases where the currency of a foreign country is exchanged for foreign currency ( i.e. , u.s. dollars ) obtained from export transactions , is defined as the difference between : ( 1 ) the amount of currency provided by a foreign country in which the subject merchandise is produced , and ( 2 ) the amount of currency such country would have provided if the real effective exchange rate of its currency were not fundamentally undervalued .
the fact that such a subsidy is also provided in circumstances not involving export shall not , for that reason alone , mean it can not be considered export contingent and actionable under a countervailing duty and antidumping duty proceeding .
the administering authority shall determine that the currency of a foreign country is fundamentally undervalued if for an 18-month period : ( 1 ) the government of the country engages in protracted , large-scale intervention in one or more foreign exchange markets ; ( 2 ) the country 's real effective exchange rate is undervalued by at least 5 % ; ( 3 ) the country has experienced significant and persistent global current account surpluses ; and ( 4 ) the country 's government has foreign asset reserves exceeding the amount necessary to repay all its debt obligations falling due within the coming 12 months , 20 % percent of the country 's money supply , and the value of the country 's imports during the previous 4 months .
the bill requires the use , for calculating a country 's `` real effective exchange rate undervaluation , '' of certain guidelines of the consultative group on exchange rate issues of the international monetary fund or , if those guidelines are not available , generally accepted economic and econometric techniques and methodologies .
requires the use , also , of inflation-adjusted , trade-weighted exchange rates .
the amendments made by this act shall apply to goods from canada and mexico .
