anti-lunch shaming act of 2017 this bill amends the richard b. russell national school lunch act to establish requirements for the treatment of a child who is a student at a school participating in the national school lunch program or the school breakfast program and is unable to pay for a meal at the school .
the bill applies to a child who either does not have funds to pay for a meal or has outstanding credit that was extended by a school food authority ( sfa ) .
a sfa may not permit public identification or stigmatization of the child , such as by requiring a wristband or hand stamp .
the child also may not be required to : ( 1 ) perform chores or activities that are not required of students generally , or ( 2 ) dispose of food after it has been served to the child .
any communication related to outstanding credit must be directed to the child 's parent or guardian .
a child may be required to deliver a letter regarding outstanding credit that is addressed to a parent or guardian if the letter is not distributed to the child in a manner that stigmatizes the child .
the bill also expresses the sense of congress regarding several issues regarding the administration of the school meal programs .
