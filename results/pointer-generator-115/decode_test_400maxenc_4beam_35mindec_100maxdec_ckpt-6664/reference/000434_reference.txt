repeatedly flooded communities preparation act this bill amends the national flood insurance act of 1968 to require a community that participates in the national flood insurance program and has been repeatedly flooded , as specified by the bill , to : ( 1 ) assess the continuing risks to community areas repeatedly damaged by floods ; and ( 2 ) develop and implement a publicly available , community-specific plan for mitigating continuing flood risks to such areas .
the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) must , upon request , provide a community with appropriate data to assist in preparation of the required plan .
in making decisions with respect to awarding mitigation grants under the act , fema may consider the extent to which a community has complied with these requirements and is working to remedy problems with repeatedly flooded areas .
a community that does not comply with these requirements shall be subject to appropriate sanctions , including suspension from the national flood insurance program .
