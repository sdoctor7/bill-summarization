expresses the sense of the house of representatives that : ( 1 ) judge james l. robart of the western district of washington ignored the constitution , federal law , and court precedent in issuing a temporary restraining order against executive order 13769 , entitled `` protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the united states '' ; and ( 2 ) the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit erred in failing to reverse judge robart 's order .
among the executive order 's major provisions are restrictions on the entry of immigrants and nonimmigrants from seven countries ( iran , iraq , libya , somalia , sudan , syria , and yemen ) and additional limitations on refugee admissions to the united states .
