critical access and rural equity act of 2017 or the care act of 2017 this bill amends title xviii ( medicare ) of the social security act to specify that , for purposes of determining medicare payment and reasonable costs for both inpatient and outpatient critical access hospital ( cah ) services , the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) shall recognize as allowable costs those related to specified emergency , diagnostic , anesthetist , community health , and off-campus clinical services .
furthermore , in determining payment and reasonable costs for both inpatient and outpatient cah services , cms shall not disallow payment to a cah on the basis that such payment offsets the cost of a current permissible health care-related tax imposed on and paid by the cah .
cms must make specified payment adjustments to account for such a tax .
generally , under current law , a facility must be located beyond a specified driving distance from another hospital or facility in order to be designated as a cah .
the bill specifies that this requirement does not apply with respect to a cah 's off-campus provider-based clinic .
current law further requires a facility to provide certain 24-hour emergency care services as a condition of designation as a cah .
the bill allows cms to waive this requirement with respect to a facility that coordinates with a nearby facility or hospital that provides such services .
