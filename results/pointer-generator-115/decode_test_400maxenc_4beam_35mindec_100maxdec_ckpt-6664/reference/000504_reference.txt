wetland determinations efficiency and transparency act this bill amends the food security act of 1985 to revise the process that the natural resources conservation service ( nrcs ) uses to make a wetland determination , delineation , or certification .
the nrcs must make a determination , delineation , or certification within 60 days .
if the nrcs misses the deadline , it must provide a reasonable transition period for a person to come into compliance with the decision without losing eligibility for certain payments and loans .
a decision is subject to judicial review , and a person is not required to exhaust all administrative remedies prior to bringing a suit in federal court .
in the case of a dispute , the nrcs must bear the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence and provide a copy of the agency record upon request .
the department of agriculture ( usda ) must permit a person to secure technical assistance from an approved source , other than the nrcs , for the preparation of : ( 1 ) a conservation plan or similar plan required as a condition for usda assistance , and ( 2 ) a wetland delineation or determination .
