this bill amends the communications act of 1934 to direct the federal communications commission ( fcc ) to promulgate customer privacy regulations that require telecommunications services , broadband internet access services , and interconnected voip services to : notify a customer about the collection , use , and sharing of customer proprietary information that is individually identifiable customer proprietary network information , personally identifiable information , or the content of communications ; obtain opt-in approval from a customer to use and share sensitive customer proprietary information about financial or health information , children , social security numbers , precise geolocation , content of communications , call detail information , web browsing or application usage history , or other customary proprietary information that the fcc determines to be sensitive ; not refuse to serve a customer who does not consent to the use and sharing of customer proprietary information for commercial purposes under a `` take-it-or-leave-it '' offer ; develop data security practices ; and notify customers of security breaches .
the fcc must also implement strong protection for de-identified customary proprietary information to prevent re-identifying such information .
