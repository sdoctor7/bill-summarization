this bill directs the u.s. army corps of engineers to operate the federal water resources projects on the apalachicola , chattahoochee , and flint rivers in alabama , florida , and georgia in a manner that ensures the maintenance of freshwater flows .
the term `` freshwater flows '' is defined as the quality , quantity , timing , and variability of freshwater flows required to : ( 1 ) support and reestablish the ecological integrity of the rivers , commercial and recreational fisheries dependent on freshwater flows into apalachicola bay and adjacent waters , and thriving and diverse fish , wildlife , and plant populations similar to those found prior to construction of the projects ; ( 2 ) restore and recover species that are endangered , threatened , or at risk ; and ( 3 ) prevent significantly harmful adverse impacts to the chattahoochee and apalachicola river ecosystems .
the corps of engineers must enter into an arrangement for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) to conduct a study that evaluates existing data related to freshwater flows and provides recommendations on how to maintain such flows .
the corps shall not issue a final water control manual based on the final environmental impact statement titled `` update of the water control manual for the apalachicola-chattahoochee-flint river basin in alabama , florida , and georgia and a water supply storage assessment , '' dated december 2016 , but shall : ( 1 ) issue revised water control manuals for such projects that ensure the maintenance of freshwater flows , considering the findings of noaa 's study ; ( 2 ) ensure that operational modifications needed to maintain freshwater flows are achieved while providing system-wide balance in conservation storage through the maintenance of water levels in the same action zone for each of the project reservoirs ; ( 3 ) enter into an arrangement for the national academy of sciences to carry out an independent peer review of each revised manual ; and ( 4 ) obtain written approval from the environmental protection agency , the u.s. fish and wildlife service , noaa , and the u.s. geological survey of each manual developed before a final manual may be issued .
