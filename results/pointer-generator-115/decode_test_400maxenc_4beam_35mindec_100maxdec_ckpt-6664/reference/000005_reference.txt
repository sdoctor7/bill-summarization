this bill amends the internal revenue code to specify that , for the purpose of a health savings account , an abortion is not a qualified medical expense unless : ( 1 ) the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest ; or ( 2 ) the woman suffers from a physical disorder , injury , or illness , including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself , that would , as certified by a physician , place the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is performed .
