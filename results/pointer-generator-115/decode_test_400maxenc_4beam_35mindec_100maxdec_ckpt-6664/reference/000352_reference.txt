protecting access to lifesaving screenings act ( pals act ) of 2017 this bill requires that any provision of law referring to current recommendations of the u.s. preventive services task force ( uspstf ) with respect to breast cancer screening , mammography , and prevention be administered as if : ( 1 ) the provision referred to uspstf recommendations last issued before 2009 ; and ( 2 ) those recommendations applied to any screening mammography modality , including any digital modality of such a procedure .
( in 2009 , the uspstf updated its guidelines to recommend against routine screening mammography for women between 40 to 49 years of age and to recommend biennial , instead of annual , screening mammography for most women between 50 to 74 years of age . )
this requirement shall also apply to the veterans health administration 's policy on mammography screening for veterans .
in addition , the bill amends title xviii ( medicare ) of the social security act to preserve medicare coverage for screening mammography , without a requirement for coinsurance , and expand the definition of screening mammography to include any digital modality of such a procedure .
the centers for medicare & medicaid services may not decrease the frequency with which screening mammography may be paid by medicare for a woman over 39 years of age .
