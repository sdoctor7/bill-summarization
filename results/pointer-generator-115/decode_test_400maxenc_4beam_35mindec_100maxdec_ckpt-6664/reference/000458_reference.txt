amateur radio parity act of 2017 ( sec. 3 ) this bill directs the federal communications commission ( fcc ) to amend station antenna structure regulations to prohibit a private land use restriction from applying to amateur radio stations if the restriction : precludes communications in an amateur radio service , fails to permit a licensee of amateur radio service to install and maintain an effective outdoor antenna on property under its exclusive use or control , or is not the minimum practicable restriction to accomplish the lawful purposes of a community association seeking to enforce the restriction .
before installing an outdoor antenna , however , an amateur radio licensee must obtain a community association 's prior approval .
a community association may : ( 1 ) prohibit installations on common property not under the exclusive control of the licensee , and ( 2 ) establish installation rules for amateur radio antennas and support structures .
