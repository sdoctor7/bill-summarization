this bill amends the immigration and nationality act to reauthorize the state criminal alien assistance program ( scaap ) through fy2021 .
scaap provides payments to state , local , and tribal governments to offset the costs of incarcerating certain undocumented criminal aliens .
it expands the definition of `` undocumented criminal alien '' to include an alien who has been charged with a felony or two or more misdemeanors .
additionally , the bill directs the department of justice to reimburse a state , local , or tribal government for incarceration costs and medical expenses of a criminal alien whose immigration status can not be verified by the department of homeland security .
( currently , a criminal alien with lawful immigration status does not meet the criteria for scaap reimbursement . )
