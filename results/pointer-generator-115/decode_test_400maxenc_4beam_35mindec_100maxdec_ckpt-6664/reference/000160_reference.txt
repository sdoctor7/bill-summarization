ocean acidification research partnerships act this bill amends the federal ocean acidification research and monitoring act of 2009 to require the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) to provide grants for collaborative research projects on ocean acidification developed and conducted through partnerships between the seafood industry and the academic community .
noaa must prioritize projects which : ( 1 ) address ecosystems and communities vulnerable to the impacts of ocean acidification , ( 2 ) demonstrate support from local stakeholders , or ( 3 ) utilize seafood industry assets as research and monitoring platforms .
noaa may make a grant to a partnership in which a marine-dependent industry is substituted for the seafood industry .
