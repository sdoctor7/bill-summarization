standard merger and acquisition reviews through equal rules act of 2017 this bill amends the clayton act with respect to notice to a state by the department of justice ( doj ) about federal actions brought for violations of antitrust laws .
the federal trade commission ( ftc ) shall exercise the same authority and procedures as doj under the clayton act if the ftc has brought an action under section 7 of the same act with respect to the prohibition against acquisition by one corporation of the stock of another ( merger ) that may substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly .

u.s. district courts shall have jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus commanding compliance with the ftca or any ftc order , if the ftc applies to such courts with respect to any activity related to consummation of a merger , acquisition , joint venture , or similar transaction that may result in an unfair method of competition .
