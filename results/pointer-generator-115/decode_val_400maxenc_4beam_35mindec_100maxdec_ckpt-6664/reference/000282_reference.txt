sunshine in litigation act of 2017 this bill amends the federal judicial code to prohibit a court , in any civil action in which the pleadings state facts relevant to the protection of public health or safety , from entering an order restricting the disclosure of information obtained through discovery , approving a settlement agreement that would restrict such disclosure , or restricting access to court records , unless the court first makes independent findings : ( 1 ) that the order would not restrict the disclosure of information relevant to the protection of public health or safety ; or ( 2 ) that the public interest in the disclosure of past , present , or potential health or safety hazards is outweighed by a specific and substantial interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the information and that the requested protective order is no broader than necessary to protect the confidentiality interest asserted .
courts are prohibited from enforcing any provision of : ( 1 ) an agreement between or among parties to the civil action , or an order entered under this bill , that restricts a party from disclosing information to any federal or state agency with authority to enforce laws regulating an activity relating to such information ; or ( 2 ) a settlement agreement between or among parties to such civil action that prohibits a party from disclosing that a settlement was reached or the terms of the settlement ( excluding any money paid ) that involve matters relevant to the protection of public health or safety , or from discussing matters relevant to the protection of public health or safety involved in such civil action .
