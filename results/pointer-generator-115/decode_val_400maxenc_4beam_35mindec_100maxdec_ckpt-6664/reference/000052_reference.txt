enhancing educational opportunities for all students act this bill amends the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 to allow a state educational agency to allocate grant funds among local educational agencies based on the number of eligible children ( children age 5 to 17 from a family with an income below the poverty level ) enrolled in the public schools and the state-accredited private schools within each local agency 's geographic jurisdiction .
this bill also amends the internal revenue code to : ( 1 ) allow payment of home school expenses from coverdell education savings accounts ; ( 2 ) remove the dollar limitation on contributions to coverdell education savings accounts and require such accounts to provide adequate safeguards to prevent contributions from exceeding the amount necessary to provide for the qualified education expenses of the account beneficiary ; and ( 3 ) allow tax-exempt qualified tuition programs ( 529 tuition programs ) to pay qualified pre-kindergarten , elementary , and secondary education expenses .
