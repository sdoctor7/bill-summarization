head start improvement act of 2017 this bill amends the head start act to replace the existing head start program with block grants to states and indian tribes for prekindergarten ( pre-k ) education .
instead of providing direct financial assistance to head start agencies , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) shall allot block grant funds for pre-k education among eligible states and indian tribes in accordance with their relative proportions of children , age five and younger , from low-income households .
grant recipients shall use the grant funds to : ( 1 ) award subgrants to eligible entities that provide pre-k education programs ; ( 2 ) administer such programs ; and ( 3 ) provide technical assistance , oversight , monitoring , research , and training .
under current law , hhs is authorized to designate , monitor , and establish standards for head start agencies .
the bill instead shifts pre-k program oversight and control to states and indian tribes , which shall have full flexibility to use grant funds to finance the pre-k programs of their choice .
in addition , grant recipients may use grant funds to establish portable voucher systems that allow costs to be paid for attendance at private pre-k education programs .
under current law , federal financial assistance for a head start program is generally limited to 80 % of total program costs .
the bill maintains this limitation by requiring grant recipients to provide matching funds equal to 20 % of the grant amount .
