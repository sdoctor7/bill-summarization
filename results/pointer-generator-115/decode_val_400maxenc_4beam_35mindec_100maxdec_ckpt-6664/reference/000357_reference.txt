career-ready student veterans act this bill adds the following new criteria for state approval , with respect to the department of veterans affairs ( va ) educational assistance , of applications of educational institutions providing veterans with non-accredited courses : a program to prepare an individual for state licensure or certification must meet any state instructional curriculum licensure or certification requirements ; or a program to prepare an individual for employment pursuant to standards developed by a state board or agency in an occupation requiring approval or licensure must be approved or licensed by that entity .
the va may waive either of these two requirements if : the educational institution is accredited by an agency or association recognized by the department of education ; the program did not meet the requirements during the two-year period preceding the waiver date ; the waiver furthers the purposes of the educational assistance programs or would further the education interests of individuals eligible for program assistance ; and the educational institution does not provide any incentive payment based on securing enrollments or financial aid to any persons or entities engaged in student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the award of student financial assistance , except for recruitment of foreign students residing in foreign countries who are ineligible for federal student assistance .
the va shall submit to congress notice of , and justification for , a waiver within 30 days of issuance .
the va shall disapprove a course of education unless the educational institution providing it discloses publicly any conditions or additional requirements required to obtain the license , certification , or approval for which the course is designed to provide preparation .
if after enrollment in a course subject to disapproval an individual pursues more courses of education at the same educational institution while remaining continuously enrolled , such courses shall not be subject to disapproval by reason of this bill .
