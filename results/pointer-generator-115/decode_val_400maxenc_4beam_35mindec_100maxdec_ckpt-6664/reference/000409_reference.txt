common sense nutrition disclosure act of 2017 this bill amends the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act to revise the nutritional information that restaurants and retail food establishments must disclose .
the nutrient content disclosure statement on the menu or menu board must include : ( 1 ) the number of calories contained in the whole menu item ; ( 2 ) the number of servings and number of calories per serving ; or ( 3 ) the number of calories per common unit of the item , such as for a multi-serving item that is typically divided before presentation to the consumer .
nutritional information may be provided solely by a remote-access menu ( e.g. , an internet menu ) for food establishments where the majority of orders are placed by customers who are off-premises .
establishments with self-serve food may comply with the requirements for restaurants or place signs with nutritional information adjacent to each food item .
an establishment 's nutrient content disclosures may vary from actual nutrient content if the disclosures comply with current standards for reasonable basis .
establishments with standard menu items that come in different flavors , varieties , or combinations , that are listed as a single menu item can determine and disclose nutritional information using specified methods or methods allowed by the food and drug administration ( fda ) .
regulations pursuant to this bill or the clause amended by this bill can not take effect earlier than two years after final regulations are promulgated .
the fda may not exempt states from nutrition labeling requirements .
