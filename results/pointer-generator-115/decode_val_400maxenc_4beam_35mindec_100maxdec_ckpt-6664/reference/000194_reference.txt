retirement security for american workers act this bill amends the internal revenue code and the employee retirement income security act of 1974 ( erisa ) to modify the qualification requirements for certain multiple employer retirement plans .
a multiple employer plan that meets certain criteria may not be disqualified or otherwise lose its tax-favored status because one or more participating employers fail to take actions required with respect to the plan .
the bill applies to a multiple employer defined contribution plan or a plan that consists of individual retirement accounts that either : ( 1 ) is sponsored by employers that both have a common interest other than having adopted the plan and control the plan , or ( 2 ) have a pooled plan provider .
the bill does not apply unless the terms of the plan require a noncompliant employer to , subject to the discretion of the internal revenue service , ( 1 ) transfer assets of the plan attributable to the employees of the noncompliant employer to other specified retirement plans , and ( 2 ) be liable for plan liabilities attributable to employees of the noncompliant employer .
for the purposes of this bill , a defined contribution plan that is established or maintained for the purpose of providing benefits to the employees of two or more employers and that meets certain requirements ( a pooled employer plan ) is treated for the purposes of erisa as a single plan that is a multiple employer plan .
