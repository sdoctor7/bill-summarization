born-alive abortion survivors protection act this bill amends the federal criminal code to require any health care practitioner who is present when a child is born alive following an abortion or attempted abortion to : ( 1 ) exercise the same degree of care as reasonably provided to any other child born alive at the same gestational age , and ( 2 ) ensure that such child is immediately admitted to a hospital .
the term `` born alive '' means the complete expulsion or extraction from his or her mother , at any stage of development , who after such expulsion or extraction breathes or has a beating heart , pulsation of the umbilical cord , or definite movement of voluntary muscles , regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut .
also , a health care practitioner or other employee who has knowledge of a failure to comply with these requirements must immediately report such failure to an appropriate law enforcement agency .
an individual who violates the provisions of this bill is subject to a criminal fine , up to five years in prison , or both .
an individual who commits an overt act that kills a child born alive is subject to criminal prosecution for murder .
the bill bars the criminal prosecution of a mother of a child born alive for conspiracy to violate these provisions , for being an accessory after the fact , or for concealment of felony .
a woman who undergoes an abortion or attempted abortion may file a civil action for damages against an individual who violates this bill .
