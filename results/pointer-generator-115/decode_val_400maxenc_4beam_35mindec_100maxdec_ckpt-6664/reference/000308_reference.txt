a `` transportation network company '' is an entity that uses a digital network to connect riders to drivers affiliated with the entity to transport the rider using a vehicle owned , leased , or otherwise authorized for use by the driver to a point chosen by the rider .
the benefit is subject to a limit on the aggregate amount of transportation fringe benefits for parking and a qualified alternative commuter transportation service that may be excluded from gross income .
