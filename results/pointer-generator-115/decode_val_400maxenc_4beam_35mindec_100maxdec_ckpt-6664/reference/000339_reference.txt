this bill requires the office of research and development at the environmental protection agency to enter into an agreement with the national academy of sciences to provide a comprehensive assessment of research on the implications of the use of mid-level ethanol blends , which compares mid-level ethanol blends to gasoline blends containing 10 % or 0 % ethanol .
a mid-level ethanol blend is an ethanol-gasoline blend containing 10 % - 20 % of ethanol that is intended to be used in any conventional gasoline-powered motor vehicle or nonroad vehicle or engine .
the assessment must : ( 1 ) evaluate the environmental , safety , durability , and performance effects of the introduction of mid-level blends on onroad , nonroad , and marine engines , onroad and nonroad vehicles , and related equipment ; and ( 2 ) identify areas of research , development , and testing necessary to ensure that existing motor fuel infrastructure is not adversely impacted by mid-level ethanol blends and to reduce the risk of misfueling by users at various points in the distribution and supply chain .
the office must report on the assessment 's findings .
any waivers granted under the clean air act to allow the sale of mid-level ethanol blends for use in motor vehicles are nullified .
the office is also prohibited from granting new waivers until after the report is submitted .
